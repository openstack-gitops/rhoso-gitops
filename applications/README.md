# OpenShift GitOps Applications

Contains Application manifests for OpenShift GitOps to manage the deployment of
the common OpenStack components in preparation for network configuration and
deployment of an OpenStack control plane.

These Applications are intended to be applied to the GitOps environment on the
Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) hub cluster. Ultimately this
directory is likely deprecated, and was originally used in a proof-of-concept
of using a hub cluster to manage an OpenShift cluster for a RHOSO deployment on
a managed cluster.
