# Validated Architecture (VA) Base Applications

These base Applications are for deployments where installation is being managed
through a hub cluster such as Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. These
Applications are intended to be used as a push application to get the initial
setup onto a managed cluster.

The Applications in this base location make use of Validated Architectures
(https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/architecture) and are intended for
use in upstream deployment testing.
